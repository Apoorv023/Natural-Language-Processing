The given code finds the verbs and nouns in two books and creates the frequency histogram of different categories of noun and verb for each book. Further, this code recognizes various entities present in the books and then also finds the relation among those entities. Entity relationships for a particular line or statement present in the books can be visualized with the use of "displacy.serve(piano_doc, style='dep')" right after the sentence's relationship has been defined. The code does not use it because each and every line cannnot be visualized. The books for this code are taken from the site http://www.gutenberg.org
